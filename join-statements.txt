1. How do you find related data held in two separate data tables?

Use a JOIN clause, combining two tables into one

2. Explain, in your own words, the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Give a real-world example for each.

INNER JOIN is the most common type. An output row is produced for every pair of input rows that match on the join conditions.

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
//All rows where customerID in Orders and Customers tables match

LEFT OUTER JOIN The same as an inner join, except that if there is any row for which no matching row in the table on the right can be found a row is output containing the values from the table on the left with NULL for each value in the table on the right if no match. This means that every row from the table on the left will appear at least once in the output

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
LEFT OUTER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
//All rows in Orders table whether they have an entry in Customers table or not

RIGHT OUTER JOIN The same as a left outer join, except with the roles of the tables reversed. Every row from the table on the right will appear at least once in the output, with NULL for each missing elements in the left table.

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
RIGHT OUTER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
//All rows in Customers table whether they have an entry in Orders table or not

3. Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real-world example for each.

A primary key is a column or group of columns that uniquely identify a row. Every table should have a primary key. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table whose values must have matching values in the primary key of another (or the same) table.

4. Define aliasing. 

The technique of creating short variable names, usually a single letter, to replace the table name in a query using AS, e.g. FROM tableName AS anyVariable or JOIN tableName AS anyVariable

5. Change this query so that you are using aliasing:

SELECT p.name, c.salary,
c.vacation_days
FROM professor AS p
JOIN compensation AS c
ON p.id = c.professor_id;

6. Why would you use a NATURAL JOIN? Give a real-world example

As a shortcut to using USING and having to list out columns shared by both tables. The columns in common appear only once in the output table without the need to create a list of shared columns as with USING.

7. Using this Employee schema and data, write queries to find the following information:
List all employees and all shifts.

SELECT employees.name, shifts.date, shifts.start_time, shifts.end_time
FROM scheduled_shifts
INNER JOIN employees
ON employees.id = scheduled_shifts.employee_id
INNER JOIN shifts
ON shifts.id = scheduled_shifts.shift_id
ORDER BY shifts.date ASC,
         shifts.start_time ASC;

8. Using this Adoption schema and data, please write queries to retrieve the following information and include the results:
Create a list of all volunteers. If the volunteer is fostering a dog, include each dog as well.

SELECT first_name, last_name, dogs.name
FROM volunteers
LEFT OUTER JOIN dogs
ON dogs.id = volunteers.foster_dog_id;
