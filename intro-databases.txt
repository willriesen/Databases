"A Clockwork Orange" = String
42 = integer
09/02/1945 = date

$15.99 = float/currency

2) Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: Use a database when storing lots of data and when there will be frequent adds, deletes, and edits. Use a text file when data needs to be read by humans..

3) Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: Most programming languages are procedural. One must define the procedure or process to be followed to get the result. SQL is not procedural but rather declarative, meaning one declares what you want in your result and SQL takes care of the procedure of "how" under the hood.

4) In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: Data is stored in a table-like structure with the use of binary numbers(1,0). The table is an object. The columns and rows contain cells that hold the keys and values. All of the information is structured in a unique way so that the user can make queries for information. The database sends information in formats such as json files. When an API request is made from one server to another, the database sends the file.

5) Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Table -	 A collection of related data held in a structured format
Row - 	 A single, implicitly structured data item in a table
Column - A set of data values of a particular simple type, one value for each row
Value -	 A representation of data contained in a Cell

6) List three data types that can be used in a table.

Strings
Integers
Floats
